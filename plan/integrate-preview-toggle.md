# Integrate Preview Toggle - Implementation Summary

## Issue Identified
The custom prompts modal had a separate preview section below the content textarea, which the user wanted to remove and replace with an integrated solution using a toggle button.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Preview Toggle State
- Added `showPreview` state variable to track toggle status
- Modified the existing `useEffect` hook to work with the new state

### 2. Removed Separate Preview Section
- Deleted the entire "Preview Section" div (lines 302-317 in the original code)
- This included the preview label, content display, and explanatory text

### 3. Added Preview Toggle Button
- Added a new button section with "Preview"/"Edit" text that toggles based on state
- Positioned the button at the end of the form for easy access
- Styled to match the existing UI design

### 4. Modified Textarea Behavior
- Updated the textarea to show either raw content or processed preview based on `showPreview` state
- Made the textarea read-only when showing preview
- Changed placeholder text to be context-sensitive
- Disabled editing when in preview mode

## Implementation Details

### State Management
```javascript
const [showPreview, setShowPreview] = useState(false);
```

### Textarea Value Logic
```javascript
value={showPreview ? previewContent : formData.content}
```

### Editing Restrictions
```javascript
// Disable editing when in preview mode
onChange={(e) => !showPreview && setFormData({ content: e.target.value })}
readOnly={showPreview}
```

### Context-Sensitive Placeholder
```javascript
placeholder={showPreview ? "Processed preview will appear here..." : "Enter your prompt content here..."}
```

## User Experience

### When "Preview" Mode is Off (Default)
- Textarea shows raw prompt content
- User can edit the content normally
- "Preview" button available to toggle to preview mode

### When "Preview" Mode is On
- Textarea shows processed content with placeholders replaced
- Textarea is read-only to prevent editing processed text
- "Edit" button available to return to edit mode
- Placeholder text indicates it's preview mode

## Verification
The changes ensure that:

1. **Removed Separate Preview**: No more separate preview section taking up space
2. **Integrated Toggle**: Preview functionality is now integrated with the content area
3. **Intuitive UX**: Clear visual indication of mode with button text changing between "Preview" and "Edit"
4. **Protected Content**: Raw content is preserved and not editable when viewing preview
5. **Responsive Design**: Toggle button is positioned appropriately in the UI

## Testing
To verify the changes work:

1. Open the custom prompts modal
2. Navigate to the "Create New" tab
3. Enter content with placeholders
4. Click "Preview" button
5. Verify textarea shows processed content
6. Verify textarea is read-only
7. Click "Edit" button
8. Verify textarea returns to editable raw content
9. Save the prompt and verify it works correctly

## Technical Notes
- All existing functionality is preserved
- No changes to form validation or data storage
- Preview processing logic remains unchanged
- Minimal performance impact from additional state variable
