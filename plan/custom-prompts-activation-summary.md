# Custom Prompts Activation Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the custom system prompts feature, allowing users to create, save, edit, and apply custom system prompts with placeholders through a modal interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. State Management
- Created `useCustomPromptsStore` using Zustand for centralized state management
- Implemented localStorage persistence using Zustand middleware
- Managed prompt lifecycle (create, read, update, delete)
- Tracked active prompt state for activation/deactivation

### 2. Modal Interface
- Built responsive modal with tabbed navigation ("My Prompts" and "Create New")
- Implemented form validation with user-friendly error messages
- Added placeholder insertion helper for easy prompt creation
- Created live preview functionality showing placeholder replacements

### 3. Prompt Management
- Full CRUD operations for custom prompts
- Form validation for prompt name and content
- Placeholder syntax validation
- Confirmation dialogs for delete operations

### 4. Placeholder System
- Support for five placeholders: `{{user}}`, `{{char}}`, `{{user_description}}`, `{{char_description}}`, `{{scenario}}`
- Dynamic placeholder replacement with actual character/user data
- Validation for invalid placeholders
- Nested placeholder processing (placeholders within scenario text)

### 5. Activation/Deactivation
- Toggle button for activating/deactivating prompts ("Activate"/"Deactivate")
- Visual highlighting of active prompt cards
- Removal of redundant alert notifications
- Direct integration with existing visual feedback system

### 6. UI/UX Enhancements
- Integrated preview toggle in content area (Edit/Preview modes)
- Visual mode indicators with color coding and icons
- Context-sensitive styling for different states
- Character counter for content length

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
1. **`useCustomPromptsStore.js`** - Zustand store with localStorage persistence
2. **`CustomPromptsModal.jsx`** - Main modal interface with all functionality
3. **`promptUtils.js`** - Utility functions for validation and placeholder replacement
4. **`ChatInput.jsx`** - Integration point for accessing the modal
5. **`ChatPage.jsx`** - Integration with system prompt processing

### Data Flow
1. User creates/edits prompts in modal
2. Prompts saved to Zustand store with localStorage persistence
3. User activates prompt via toggle button
4. Active prompt tracked in store state
5. ChatPage detects active prompt and uses it instead of default
6. All API calls use the active custom prompt when present

### Key Technical Decisions
- **State Management**: Zustand chosen for simplicity and React integration
- **Persistence**: localStorage via Zustand middleware for offline access
- **UI Pattern**: Toggle button replacing separate activate/deactivate actions
- **Visual Feedback**: Card highlighting replacing alert notifications
- **Placeholder Processing**: Recursive replacement to handle nested placeholders

## User Experience

### Workflow
1. Access modal via "#Prompts" button in chat input
2. View existing prompts or create new ones
3. Use placeholder helper for easy insertion
4. Preview processed content in real-time
5. Save prompts for future use
6. Activate prompts via toggle button
7. Visual confirmation through card highlighting

### Interface Design
- Clean, consistent styling matching existing app theme
- Intuitive tabbed navigation
- Clear visual hierarchy and feedback
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Accessible controls with proper labeling

## Testing Performed

### Functional Testing
- ✅ Prompt creation with validation
- ✅ Prompt editing and updating
- ✅ Prompt deletion with confirmation
- ✅ Placeholder insertion and replacement
- ✅ Custom prompt activation/deactivation
- ✅ Visual highlighting of active prompts
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ localStorage persistence

### Edge Cases
- ✅ Empty prompt list handling
- ✅ Long content handling
- ✅ Invalid placeholder detection
- ✅ Duplicate name prevention
- ✅ Deleting active prompt auto-deactivation

### Integration Testing
- ✅ Modal opening/closing
- ✅ Tab navigation
- ✅ Prompt activation in chat
- ✅ System message updates
- ✅ API communication with custom prompts

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `app/store/useCustomPromptsStore.js`
- `app/components/CustomPromptsModal.jsx`
- `app/utils/promptUtils.js`

### Modified Files
- `app/components/ChatInput.jsx` - Added modal trigger
- `app/components/ChatPage.jsx` - Integrated custom prompt usage

### Documentation
- Multiple planning and implementation documents in `plan/` directory

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. Import/export prompts as JSON
2. Categorization/tagging of prompts
3. Search and filter functionality
4. Prompt templates/examples
5. Sharing prompts between users

### Technical Improvements
1. Enhanced form validation with real-time feedback
2. Improved error handling with user guidance
3. Additional placeholder types
4. Prompt versioning/history
5. Performance optimizations for large prompt collections

## Conclusion

The custom prompts feature has been successfully implemented with a focus on usability, reliability, and integration with the existing application. The removal of alert notifications in favor of visual card highlighting, combined with the toggle button interface, provides a cleaner and more intuitive user experience.

All requirements from the original specification have been met, with additional enhancements to placeholder processing and UI/UX design. The implementation follows React and Zustand best practices, ensuring maintainability and extensibility for future enhancements.
