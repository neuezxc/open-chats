## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

`‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY`
`‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)`
`üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers`

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a user configuring API settings, I want to manage my API connection details and parameter configurations in a tabbed modal interface so that I can easily customize my AI model interactions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Opening and navigating the modal**
Given I am on the application interface
When I click the API Key button
Then the API Settings modal opens with "Connection" tab selected by default

**Scenario 2: Configuring connection settings**
Given I am viewing the Connection tab
When I enter my API key and model ID
Then the values are captured for use in API calls

**Scenario 3: Configuring parameter settings**
Given I am viewing the Parameters tab
When I adjust the slider controls
Then the numeric values update in real-time and are captured for API calls

**Scenario 4: Saving settings**
Given I have made changes in either tab
When I click "Save Settings"
Then my configurations are saved and the modal closes

**Scenario 5: Canceling changes**
Given I have made changes in either tab
When I click "Cancel"
Then my changes are discarded and the modal closes

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a user enters an invalid API key format?
- What happens if a user tries to save parameter values outside the defined ranges?
- What happens if a user switches tabs without saving changes?
