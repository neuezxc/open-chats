# Remove Prompt Length Limit - Implementation Summary

## Issue Identified
The custom prompts feature had an artificial length limit of 200 characters on the prompt content textarea, and the UI was showing a misleading "2000" character limit.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed maxLength Attribute
In `app/components/CustomPromptsModal.jsx`, I removed the `maxLength={200}` attribute from the textarea element (line 283), which was restricting users to only 200 characters.

### 2. Updated UI Text
Changed the character counter display from:
```
{formData.content.length}/2000
```
to:
```
{formData.content.length} characters
```

This removes the confusing "2000" limit that didn't match the actual restriction.

## Verification
The changes ensure that:

1. Users can now enter prompts of any length in the textarea
2. The UI accurately reflects that there is no character limit
3. All existing functionality remains intact
4. Form validation still works correctly (required fields, placeholder validation)

## Testing
To verify the changes work:

1. Open the custom prompts modal
2. Navigate to the "Create New" tab
3. Enter a prompt longer than 200 characters
4. Verify that you can continue typing without restriction
5. Save the prompt and verify it's stored correctly
6. Activate the prompt and verify it works in chat

## Notes
- The change only affects the UI input restriction
- Backend storage (localStorage) has no practical limit for this use case
- All existing validations for required fields and placeholder correctness remain in place
- The character counter now simply shows the current length without implying any limit
