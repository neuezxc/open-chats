# Enhanced Preview Styling - Implementation Summary

## Issue Identified
The user wanted visual cues to clearly indicate whether the textarea is in preview (read) mode or edit mode. The previous implementation had minimal styling differences that weren't obvious enough.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Visual Mode Indicator
- Created a new header bar above the textarea that clearly shows the current mode
- Used colored backgrounds and icons to distinguish between modes:
  - **Edit Mode**: Green background with pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è)
  - **Preview Mode**: Blue background with eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è)
- Added descriptive text ("Edit Mode" or "Preview Mode")

### 2. Enhanced Textarea Styling
- Updated border colors to match the mode:
  - **Edit Mode**: Standard borders matching the existing theme
  - **Preview Mode**: Blue borders to indicate read-only state
- Added subtle background color changes:
  - **Edit Mode**: Default background
  - **Preview Mode**: Slightly darker background with blue tint
- Maintained the cursor change to indicate interactivity

### 3. Improved UX Consistency
- Rounded corners adjusted to match the mode indicator (rounded-t for indicator, rounded-b for textarea)
- Consistent color scheme with the rest of the application
- Clear visual hierarchy with the mode indicator standing out

## Implementation Details

### Mode Indicator Bar
```jsx
<div className={`flex items-center px-3 py-1 rounded-t-[var(--border-radius-sm)] text-xs font-medium ${
  showPreview
    ? "bg-blue-500/20 text-blue-300 border border-b-0 border-blue-500/50"
    : "bg-green-500/20 text-green-300 border border-b-0 border-green-500/50"
}`}>
  {showPreview ? (
    <>
      <span className="mr-2">üëÅÔ∏è</span> Preview Mode
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      <span className="mr-2">‚úèÔ∏è</span> Edit Mode
    </>
  )}
</div>
```

### Textarea Styling
```jsx
className={`w-full bg-[var(--background)] border ${
  formErrors.content
    ? "border-red-500"
    : "border-[var(--config-button-border)]"
} rounded-b-[var(--border-radius-sm)] p-3 text-[var(--character-message-color)] min-h-[300px] ${
  showPreview
    ? "bg-gray-800/30 border-blue-500/50 cursor-default"
    : "bg-[var(--background)] border-[var(--config-button-border)]"
}`}
```

## Visual Design Choices

### Color Scheme
- **Green (#10b981)**: Associated with editing and active states
- **Blue (#3b82f6)**: Associated with viewing and passive states
- **Transparency (20%/30%)**: Allows underlying theme colors to show through while adding emphasis

### Icons
- **Pencil (‚úèÔ∏è)**: Universally recognized symbol for editing/writing
- **Eye (üëÅÔ∏è)**: Universally recognized symbol for viewing/reading

### Typography
- **Small Font Size (text-xs)**: Doesn't dominate the UI
- **Bold Weight (font-medium)**: Clearly readable but not overwhelming
- **Consistent Padding**: Even spacing around text

## User Experience Improvements

### Immediate Recognition
- Users can instantly tell which mode they're in without reading text
- Color coding reinforces the meaning (green = go/edit, blue = view)

### Consistent Patterns
- Follows common UI patterns found in other applications
- Matches the existing application theme while adding distinctive elements

### Accessibility
- High contrast between text and background
- Clear visual distinction between states
- Icon + text combination accommodates different learning preferences

## Verification
The changes ensure that:

1. **Clear Visual Differentiation**: Modes are obviously different in appearance
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Mode changes are instantly visible
3. **Theme Consistency**: Colors and styling match the existing application
4. **Responsive Design**: Elements adapt to different screen sizes
5. **Accessibility Standards**: Good contrast and clear indicators

## Testing
To verify the changes work:

1. Open the custom prompts modal
2. Navigate to the "Create New" tab
3. Observe the green "Edit Mode" indicator
4. Click the "Preview" button
5. Verify the indicator changes to blue "Preview Mode" with eye icon
6. Confirm textarea styling changes appropriately
7. Click "Edit" button
8. Verify return to green "Edit Mode" styling

## Technical Notes
- All styling uses Tailwind classes for consistency
- No additional dependencies required
- Minimal performance impact from additional elements
- Compatible with existing theme customization
